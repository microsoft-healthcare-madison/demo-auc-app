        <h2 is-upgraded>Welcome, student!</h2>
<p>This codelab is intended to teach you about the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/" target="_blank">SMART launch framework</a>, <a href="https://cds-hooks.org/" target="_blank">CDS Hooks</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/smart-web-messaging" target="_blank">SMART Web Messaging</a> by walking you through a coding exercise that uses those technologies.</p>
<aside class="special"><h3 is-upgraded>Profile Audience</h3>
<p>This guide is intended for programmers who wish to <em>learn by doing</em>.  You should already have a working knowledge of web programing, access to a development machine, and about <strong>2 to 5 total hours</strong> to dedicate to completing the whole codelab.<br><br>Your completion time will vary based on your familiarity with Javascript, web programming concepts, and the API in general.<br></p>
</aside>
<h3 is-upgraded>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>This guide assumes you are already familiar with javascript and are comfortable with web programming concepts.  It also helps to know the basics of <code>git</code>, but there will be example commands throughout for convenience.  The provided initial codebase uses <code>javascript</code>, <code>node</code>, <code>nvm</code>, <code>npm</code>, and <code>express</code> - so some prior experience with those tools will be helpful, but not required.  JavaScript in the browser and in Node.js, and the express Web framework for Node.js</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Contributing</h3>
<p>As always, you are free to re-write entire portions of the code in whatever framework you like (and please feel free to share your work with us)!</p>
<p>The codelab has a wiki which should help you decide how to best contribute:<br><a href="https://github.com/microsoft-healthcare-madison/demo-auc-app/wiki" target="_blank">https://github.com/microsoft-healthcare-madison/demo-auc-app/wiki</a></p>
<p>Also, take notice of the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft-healthcare-madison/demo-auc-app/issues" target="_blank">Report a mistake</a> link that appears in the lower left corner of each page!</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Major Milestones</h3>
<p>You will start with an already-implemented form-entry app that evaluates the appropriateness of a potential advanced imaging order and displays a rating of either <code>appropriate</code>, <code>not-appropriate</code>, or <code>no-guidelines-apply</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>v1: Make the app SMART-launch capable, enabling an EHR to launch it.</li>
<li>v2: Create a CDS Hooks service to evaluate a <em>draft</em> order in an EHR, and show a link to the SMART app.</li>
<li>v3: Enable the SMART app to update the draft order inside the EHR.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="warning"><h3 is-upgraded>Note for Students</h3>
<p>If you already have a good grasp of PAMA, the SMART launch process, and CDS Hooks, you can <strong>skip</strong> ahead and begin the process <em>after</em> the CDS Hooks implementation by checking out the code at <code>v2.0</code> in the repo and advancing to the section called <strong>SMART Web Messaging</strong> in this codelab.</p>
<p>There&#39;s another git tag, <code>v3.0</code>, for the <strong>final</strong> solution.  Check out this version of the code if you just want to play with a working copy of the app.  However, if you&#39;re here to learn, it is recommended that you find time to do the full codelab.<br></p>

<h3 is-upgraded>Apropriate Use Criteria (AUC)</h3>
<p>In short, for software to determine whether an imaging technique is <em>apropriate</em> or not for a given diagnosis, several groups of specialists have been developing <em>apropriate use criteria</em> and publishing that criteria for the industry to adopt into the EHR workflow.  These AUC are regularly improved, updated, and re-published.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Provider Led Entities (PLE)</h3>
<p>The groups of experts and specialists who decide what is and isn&#39;t appropriate are called <em>Provider Led Entities</em>.  They develop the AUC out in the open and publish it reqularly for consumption by software vendors who provide CDS.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Qualified CDS Mechanisms (QCDSM)</h3>
<p>The software providers who use this criteria, the QCDSM vendors, must provide access to best practice guidelines for a wide spectrum of medical care areas.  For PAMA imaging, we are interested in the radiology imaging AUC and we have prepared a simple example of QCDSM guideline consultation software.  However, a QCDSM must be able to use more than one published set of AUC in their software, and have a method of updating their AUC periodically (See pages 4 and 5 <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/Downloads/AUCDiagnosticImaging-909377.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> for details).  As such, the QCDSM software can be quite complex, and is often implemented as a stand-alone web service.</p>
<h2 class="faq" is-upgraded>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 is-upgraded>Why are <em>CDS Hooks</em> important for PAMA?</h3>
<aside class="special"><p>To satisfy a radiologist&#39;s claim to CMS, the original order must include evidence that guidelines were consulted at the point of order entry (by the <em>ordering provider</em>).  This means that, while the ordering provider is still using the EHR, they must also be consulting guidelines for appropriate use.  By using <em>CDS Hooks</em>, the EHR can consult a guideline service automatically, as soon as it&#39;s relevant – sharing results or a link to the guideline app if further interaction is needed.<br></p>
</aside>
<h3 is-upgraded>Why is <em>SMART Web Messaging</em> important for PAMA?</h3>
<aside class="special"><p>Because the logic to determine <em>when</em> a service is or isn&#39;t appropriate can be very complex, this logic is often implemented in stand-alone web-based applications.  To enable those applications to <strong>update</strong> the current <em>draft</em> order, we need SMART Web Messaging.  With SMART Web Messaging, we can easily and securely send data and actions <em>back</em> into the EHR.</p>
</aside>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Example App" duration="2">
        <p>You are provided with a very simple, but working, guideline consultation app.  In PAMA parlance, this would be software from a Qualified CDS Mechanism, or a QCDSM.</p>
<p>Below is an embedded version of the app in its original state.  The idea is that clinicians would use this tool alongside their EHR when consulting guidelines.  The app would provide them some kind of evidence code which they could copy and paste back into the EHR before signing an order.</p>
<p>Feel free to explore the app to get a sense of how it works.  Any non-empty username and password will allow you to use the app - the login is totally fake.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Exercise Outline" duration="5">
        <h2 is-upgraded>SMART Launch</h2>
<p>You will add SMART launch capabilities to the app, allowing it to be launched by the EHR and to receive EHR data directly through the SMART launch client.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>CDS Hooks</h2>
<p>Once the app is capable of a SMART launch, you will write a CDS Hooks service to alert ordering providers when they have made an order selection that is outside of guidelines.  The alert will give them a helpful link to click on, which will launch the app <em>within the EHR</em>.  The app will read context from the EHR and use that to pre-populate the appropriate fields in its form, saving the clinician time and mental effort.</p>

<p class="image-container"><img alt="example-cards" src="img/1fe46a51076bd238.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>SMART Web Messaging</h2>
<p>Finally, a new button will be added in the app that will be able to update the draft order items with the current selection.  Upon update, evidence of guideline consultation will be attached to the order, before closing the app, returning the user to the order entry screen in the EHR.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Final Product</h2>
<p>The final product will look something like this, when running embedded in an iframe in the EHR.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="embedded-app" src="img/d305f11b4c68b4d7.png"></p>
<p>By clicking on the ‘Update EHR&#39; button, the pending order will be modified to use whatever has been selected in the form.  The iframe will then close and return the user to the EHR order entry screen.</p>
<h2 class="faq" is-upgraded>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 is-upgraded>Which EHRs currently support the technologies required to enable these services?</h3>
<aside class="special"><p>Currently, very <em>few</em> EHR vendors have implemented the required CDS Hooks or SMART Web Messaging to enable this (<a href="https://www.tsystem.com/" target="_blank"><em>T-System</em></a><em> is one notable exception</em>).  Cerner has committed to doing this, though, and it&#39;s not a matter of if, but of when.  Epic is also ‘working on it.&#39;<br><br>While this may seem like a negative thing, the other way to see the situation is that any QCDSM vendor who is <em>ready</em> with product when CDS Hooks <em>does</em> become widespread will have the mover&#39;s advantage.  Also, there is currently relatively low pressure for an EHR vendor to get ‘caught up&#39; with competitors (but that should be changing rapidly in 2020).<br><br>In other words, there is still time for <em>everyone</em> to get ready!<br><br>For a list of vendors who support CDS Hooks, please refer to this:<br><a href="https://github.com/argonautproject/cds-hooks/wiki/Readiness-and-Testing-Matrix" target="_blank">https://github.com/argonautproject/cds-hooks/wiki/Readiness-and-Testing-Matrix</a></p>

        <h2 is-upgraded>Problem</h2>
<aside class="warning"><p>It is time consuming, error-prone, and frustrating for providers when they have to switch focus to a browser window outside of the EHR, remember a URL so they can launch an external app, remember their correct username and password, and then enter patient demographic information to perform some basic task.<br></p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Solution</h2>
<aside class="special"><p>The SMART Launch Framework can dramatically improve the situation!<br><br>With the <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/" target="_blank">SMART App Launch Framework</a>, the app will be able to securely read data from the EHR through access delegation (OAuth 2) and single-sign-on (OpenID Connect).  The provider will not need to remember a separate username and password to use the app anymore, and the app will be able to pre-load form fields using the available context in the EHR.<br><br>This will reduce user errors, save the user time, and spare them some frustrations.<br></p>

<p>If you follow the overall flow of CDS Hooks in the diagram above, you can see how the EHR and the CDS Hooks service work together.  But how does the EHR <em>know</em> about the CDS Hooks service?</p>

        <p>You must understand <strong>several</strong> CDS Hooks concepts to make this service work as intended; however, the most logical starting-place is the <a href="https://github.com/cerner/cds-services-tutorial/wiki/Discovery-Endpoint" target="_blank">CDS Hooks discovery endpoint</a>.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Discovery</h2>
<p>To run a CDS Hooks service, that service must provide a discovery endpoint which describes all the CDS Hooks that your service is interested in.  In this case, we want the EHR to post a message to our service whenever the <code>order-select</code> hook is activated.  This will allow the service to process the <em>currently pending</em> order selection and return the desired ‘card&#39; data (which is then displayed by the EHR to the provider).</p>

        <h2 is-upgraded>Problem</h2>
<aside class="warning"><p>We want the user to be visually alerted in the EHR when they have selected an order where AUC guidelines should be consulted <em>while</em> ordering.  For this to work, the CDS Hooks service must be able to evaluate the <em>draft</em> order against AUC guidelines, so a card of the appropriate severity can be displayed.  However, the AUC logic is all currently available in a separate service.</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Solution</h2>
<aside class="special"><p>We will extract the AUC logic from the other service, making it available as a <em>module</em> to the CDS Hooks service.  Alternatively, if the app had provided an API, the CDS Hooks service could use that API as draft order items are selected to determine appropriateness.  Either works, but in this case the logic is easy enough to isolate as a module.</p>

<aside class="warning"><p>Again, remember that the CDS Developer Panel is your friend.  Also, remember that when you enter <code>Congenital heart disease</code> as a ‘Reason&#39; - the <code>pama-imaging</code> service will return a card.  You can quickly switch the selected service in the CDS Developer Panel to see what the Response payload looks like while developing your own service.<br><br>Also, you can <em>disable</em> the <code>pama-imaging</code> service in the sandbox if you prefer to only see the card returned by your service.<br></p>

        <h2 is-upgraded>Problem</h2>
<aside class="warning"><p>We&#39;ve done a great job modifying the original app so it can be launched from the EHR, complete with all the relevant EHR context being automatically populated.  However, any changes made by the user in the form will not automatically apply to the EHR selections, so users will have to remember what changed in the app and then re-create that work in the EHR after closing the app.  This is better, but still far from ideal.<br></p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Solution</h2>
<aside class="special"><p>We will enable the app to <em>update</em> the EHR selection by providing a new ‘Update EHR&#39; button.  We&#39;ll also provide a ‘Close App&#39; button.  These two functions will ‘close the loop&#39;, allowing a seamless integration of the AUC app within the EHR.<br></p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Design</h2>
<p>Recall the new app features that were introduced in the exercise outline.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="embedded-app" src="img/d305f11b4c68b4d7.png"></p>
<p>In the final remaining sections of this codelab, you will implement several exercises to complete the missing functionality.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Missing Functionality</h2>
<ul>
<li>The app needs to be able to inform the EHR that it is ‘all done&#39; so the EHR knows it can close the iframe used to embed the app.  This is essentially how the ‘cancel&#39; button is implemented.</li>
<li>The app needs to be able to update the current pending order based on whatever form values have been selected.  When a final selection has been made, the user will click the ‘update&#39; button to update the EHR and close the app.</li>
<li>Because the app currently uses a form to POST to a remote service for determining AUC appropriateness, it becomes awkward when trying to implement functionality that will allow the user to ‘test out&#39; various changes to order and diagnosis before updating the EHR.  So, ideally, instead of POST&#39;ing to a remote service, the form can invoke a javascript <em>function</em> which will take advantage of the new <code>auc.js</code> module.</li>
</ul>

<h2 is-upgraded>Closing the App</h2>
<p>To enable the app-closing functionality, you should have identified in the previous section that you need the following in your app.</p>
<ul>
<li>The FHIR client must have requested the <code>messaging/ui</code> scope upon launch.</li>
<li>The <code>postMessage</code> function must be used to send a <code>ui.done</code> message to the EHR.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following section we&#39;ll dig in to how sending messages can be done and implement the <code>closeApp</code> function.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Sending Messages" duration="20">
        <p>In order to send messages to the EHR, the client code must do the following:</p>

<li>Determine which window needs to receive the messages via <code>postMessage</code>.<ul>
<li>Use <code>window.parent.postMessage</code> when the client is running embedded in an <code>iframe</code>.</li>

      <google-codelab-step label="Using the AUC Module" duration="30">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Problem</h2>
<aside class="warning"><p>The earlier version of the app simply POST&#39;ed the form selections to a remote service for evaluation, displaying the appropriateness result to the page.  This makes it awkward for users to use the tool interactively, because it involves them clicking a button and then clicking ‘back&#39; for each iteration.<br></p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Solution</h2>
<aside class="special"><p><br>Since we have the AUC logic available in a module, we can include it in the page and tie the form to a javascript function, rather than relying on a remote service.  The ‘submit&#39; button will be renamed ‘evaluate&#39; and clicking it will no longer navigate away from the page.  Instead, a document element will display the ‘current&#39; appropriateness rating and update that element whenever the ‘evaluate&#39; button is clicked.</p>
<aside class="warning"><p>There are <em>many</em> other ways to solve this problem, and this particular approach was chosen because it&#39;s easy to implement and demo.  A QCDSM might wish to retain their AUC logic behind an API call or a remote service, and rely instead on fetching remote results asynchronously.<br></p>
</aside>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Design Goals</h2>
<p>Recall that in the Exercise Overview section, the end-result screenshot of the app had renamed the ‘Submit&#39; button to be ‘Evaluate&#39;.  Also, the appropriateness rating of the current selection was to be displayed on the app below the form fields.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="evaluate" src="img/5bf384ef8442a764.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Changes to <code>index.html</code></h2>
<p>Add the following changes to the existing app to enable using the AUC module within <code>index.html</code> and without requiring an external service to be available to answer requests.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;form id=&#39;auc_form&#39; onsubmit=&#34;return evaluateFormContent()&#34;&gt;
...
  &lt;input type=&#34;submit&#34; value=&#34;Evaluate&#34; /&gt;

<h2 is-upgraded>EXERCISE 2</h2>
<aside class="special"><p>Use the following implementation of <code>updateApp</code> to simply send the unchanged draft order back to the EHR, confirming in the <code>Messages</code> panel that the order payload was received.</p>

<h3 is-upgraded>IMPORTANT!</h3>
<aside class="warning"><p>Unfortunately, the background color value (<code>#cfe2f3</code>) is a <em>magic</em> attribute value.  Without this <em>exact</em> color value, the Survey object will not work as intended.</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Download buttons</h2>
